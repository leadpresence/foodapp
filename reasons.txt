Choice Tool:

The tool for development is flutter with Dart Language. Its taken as the best choice for this because it has a large usage in the present mobile development industry.

Flutter has a large community and as you may know flutter & dart Language is  highly backed by google. 
I have choosen it because I am skilled at it over react native or ionic, in addition to that flutter has good amount of packages that ensure fast development.

Drawback:

Presently the only draw back I see with flutter is that it single threaded in its processing , while native conterparts such as kotlin or java are multi-threaded. This however does not pose any chanllenges as  the framework has a built in enging that handles processing in loops in an efficient way.
